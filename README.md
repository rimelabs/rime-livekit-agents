# Rime LiveKit Agents

This public repository showcases how to run Rime with LiveKit to build real‑time voice agents. It is designed so customers and developers can quickly understand the purpose, explore the structure, and spin up an example agent that performs a full STT → LLM → TTS loop for back‑and‑forth voice conversations.

## What this repo contains

- Rime Simple Agent
  - A simple example implementation that demonstrates a complete voice conversation pipeline using LiveKit and Rime. It showcases a seamless integration of Speech-to-Text (STT) → Large Language Model (LLM) → Text-to-Speech (TTS) for natural, bidirectional voice conversations.
  - This is a simple script that serves as a perfect starting point for developers who want to see a basic STT-LLM-TTS implementation and build on top of it.
  - The code is intentionally kept straightforward and well-documented so you can easily understand, download, and run it as a foundation for your own voice agent implementation.

- Additional example(s)
  - A second, slightly more advanced project will be added soon. This README will be updated when it becomes available.
