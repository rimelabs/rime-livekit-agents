# Rime LiveKit Agents

This public repository showcases how to run Rime with LiveKit to build real‑time voice agents. It is designed so customers and developers can quickly understand the purpose, explore the structure, and spin up an example agent that performs a full STT → LLM → TTS loop for back‑and‑forth voice conversations.

## What this repo contains

- Rime-simple-agent
  - A minimal end‑to‑end voice agent that wires together speech‑to‑text (STT), a large language model (LLM), and text‑to‑speech (TTS) over LiveKit.
  - Includes a Python backend (LiveKit Agent) and a Next.js frontend for a simple web UI.
  - You can run the backend and frontend together (dev mode) or run the backend independently (console mode).
  - Setup and usage instructions are provided inside the project folder.

- Additional example(s)
  - A second, slightly more advanced project will be added soon. This README will be updated when it becomes available.
