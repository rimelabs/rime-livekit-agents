# Rime LiveKit Agents

This repository demonstrates how to set up both a frontend and a LiveKit-powered backend, enabling customers to easily clone and start using the project for their own conversational AI applications. The project is structured for flexibility: you can use the backend and frontend together, or run the backend independently in console mode. 

The core demonstration includes setting up a pipeline with SST (speech-to-text), LLM (large language model), and TTS (text-to-speech) models to create a conversational bot. This bot can be used directly via Python scripts or run in development mode with a frontend that provides real-time audio streaming and text transcription.

This repository serves as an example and starting point for integrating real-time conversational AI experiences using LiveKit, making it easy for users to adapt the setup to their own needs.

## Before You Start

If this is your first time working with LiveKit, we highly recommend spending some time reviewing the official documentation to understand the platform and its capabilities:

- **LiveKit Overview:** Learn the basics of LiveKit, including rooms, participants, and tracks: [LiveKit Docs](https://docs.livekit.io/home/)
- **LiveKit Agents:** Understand how to build and run AI agents with LiveKit: [LiveKit Agents Docs](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/)
- **LiveKit SIP Integration:** If you plan to connect to phone numbers or telephony systems, see: [LiveKit SIP Docs](https://docs.livekit.io/sip/)

Familiarizing yourself with these resources will give you a strong foundation for using and extending this repository.

> **Note:** You can also test the code directly without reading the documentation if you want to quickly see how it works. The repository is designed to be easy to set up and run out of the box for experimentation.

## Setup: Required API Keys

Before setting up the project, you need to obtain API keys for all required services and add them to a `.env` file in the project root. These keys are necessary to connect to LiveKit rooms and enable speech-to-text (STT), large language model (LLM), and other AI features.

Add the following keys to your respective `.env` file:

```
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://<project-subdomain>.livekit.cloud
RIME_API_KEY=<your_rime_api_key>
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your_deepgram_api_key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```

### How to Obtain the Keys

- **LiveKit API Keys:**
  - Sign up or log in at [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/login)
  - Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys to generate your API key, secret, and get your project URL.
- **RIME_API_KEY:**
  - Obtain from your Rime account at [Rime Tokens](https://app.rime.ai/tokens/).
- **Deepgram API Key:**
  - Sign up or log in at [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/project/b10a1314-1443-4796-811f-f099e5da682e) to generate your API key.
- **OpenAI API Key:**
  - Sign up or log in at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) to generate your API key.

Make sure to keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly.

## Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rimelabs/rime-livekit-agents.git
# or
git clone git@github.com:rimelabs/rime-livekit-agents.git
cd rime-livekit-agents
```

## Frontend Setup

To set up and run the frontend application:

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Create your environment file:**
   ```sh
   touch .env
   # Add the following keys to your .env file:
   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>
   LIVEKIT_URL=wss://<project-subdomain>.livekit.cloud
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your actual LiveKit credentials.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```sh
   pnpm run dev
   ```

The frontend should now be running locally and ready to connect to your LiveKit backend.

## Backend Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend agent:

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download required model files:**
   ```sh
   python rime_agent.py download-files
   ```

5. **Create your environment file:**
   ```sh
   touch .env
   # Add the following keys to your .env file:
   LIVEKIT_URL=<your LiveKit server URL>
   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=<your API Key>
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=<your API Secret>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API Key>
   RIME_API_KEY=<your Rime API Key>
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=<your Deepgram API Key>
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with your actual API credentials.

6. **Run the agent in different modes:**

   - **Development mode (connects to LiveKit, for use with the frontend UI):**
     ```sh
     python rime_agent.py dev
     ```
   - **Console mode (test directly from the terminal):**
     ```sh
     python rime_agent.py console
     ```
   - **Production mode (for deployment):**
     ```sh
     python rime_agent.py start
     ```
